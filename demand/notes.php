                        <h6>Consumer equilibrium</h6>
                        <p>Consumerâ€™s squilibrium means a state of maximum satisfaction. There are two basic approaches, Cardianl & Ordinal.</p>
                        <h6>Demand</h6>
                        <p>Demand is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. <br> Qd=f(P,Pn,Y,T,Ex,N,o)</p>
                        <h6>Theory of Demand</h6>
                        <p>Demand theory describes the way that changes in the quantity of a good or service demanded by consumers affects its price in the market, The theory states that the higher the price of a product is, all else equal, the less of it will be demanded, inferring a downward sloping demand curve.</p>
                        <h6>Law of Demand</h6>
                        <p>The law of demand states that other factors being constant (cetris peribus), price and quantity demand of any good and service are inversely related to each other. When the price of a product increases, the demand for the same product will fall.</p>
                        <h6>Supply</h6>
                        <p>Supply is the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to supply onto the market at a given price in a given time period. <br> Qs=f(P,C,T,Pn,Ex,G,N,O)</p>
                        <h6>Law of Supply</h6>
                        <p>Law of supply states that other factors remaining constant, price and quantity supplied of a good are directly related to each other</p>
                        <h6>Market Equilibrium</h6>
                        <p>A situation where for a particular good supply = demand. When the market is in equilibrium, there is no tendency for prices to change. We say the market-clearing price has been achieved.</p>
                        <h6>Elasticity of Demand</h6>
                        <p>Elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price. Three major types, Price, Cross Price, Income.</p>
